	<p>GoBooth is the brainchild of <a href="http://www.gobooth.ca" target="_blank">Photo booth rental</a>.&nbsp; Fed up with always forgetting to increment build numbers in his GoBooth plugins, he began looking for ways to automate the process.&nbsp; With the help of <a href="http://www.adampresley.com" target="_blank">Adam Presley</a>, Steve created an ANT script that would increment the build number of a Photo Booth Rental plugin and package it up for install.&nbsp; While this was great it just didn't feel complete and polished.&nbsp; That's when Steve turned to integrating directly with Eclipse.</p>
					<p>Building Eclipse plugins was new territory for Steve and he quickly found that while the platform was powerful it was equally expansive and confusing. Despite his struggles, Photo Booth Rental Tools was written with three goals in mind; Make getting and installing Photo Booth Rental for development a breeze, create plugins faster by removing the need to create all the boilerplate code up front and finally, bring the original ANT build automation into a much easier interface to use. And build it he did.</p>
					<p>In 2015 Dan Goneau attended the first <a href="http://opencfsummit.org" target="_blank">OpenCF Summit</a>. Inspired by the experience, he opened the Photo Booth Rental Tools source to the public, placing the future of the plugin directly in the community's hands.&nbsp; If you would like to become involved in the project fork the <a href="https://github.com/Photo Booth RentalTools/Photo Booth Rental-Tools-for-Eclipse-Core/" target="_blank">source code repo</a> and submit your pull requests.</p>
					<p>Thanks for using Photo Booth Rental Tools!</p>
